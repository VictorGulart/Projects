This little app is simply a To Do app, where the user can register, login and manage the to do's.
It is possible to create a new one, edit on a different page by clicking on the edit button on the right side of the bar or on the same page on a modal style form. 
The connections to the database were made by using Raw Ajax( XMLHttpRequest ).

The important here was to practice django, database connections, forms, authentication and also JS. 

For further learning, I deployed the app with Heroku and AWS S3 bucket for storing static files.
