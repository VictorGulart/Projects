A view function is the code written to respond to requests to the application. 
    Flask uses patterns to match the incoming request URL to the view that should handle it. 
    The view (the function) returns data that Flask turns into an outgoing response. Flask 
    can also go othe other direction and generate a URL to a view based on its name and
    arguments.
    
    A blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Rather than 
    registering views and other code directlu with an application, they, they are registered
    with a blueprint. Then the blueprint is registered with the app when it is available
    in the factory function.

When using blueprints, the name of the blueprint is prepended to the name of
the function, so the endpoint for the login function is in flaskr project is
'auth.login' because it was added to the auth blueprint.
