    ''' Creating the app as a global will bring problems in the future for the project instead it 
    is created inside a function and returned. This function is known as application factory 
    
    details about this:

    instance_relative_config: tells the app that the configuration files are relative to the instance folder
        (main folder of the project), this folder is outside flaskr and can hold data that shouldn't be committed
        to version control, such as configuration secrets and the database file.
    app.config.from_mapping(): sets some default configuration that the app will use
        SECRET_KEY: used to keep data safe. used for hashing later must be randomized and not 'dev'
        DATABASE: it's where the db will be saved. it's under app.instance_path 
    app.config.from_pyfile(): overrides the default configuration with values taken from config.py in the main folder
        if it exists. for example, when deploying it can be used to randomize the SECRET_KEY.
        test_config: it will be used instead of the instance configuration, when provided. this helps to change 
            configurations for tests that will be written later on. they will be independent of any development values
    os.makedirs(): just makes sure that the main folder exist. not flaskdir but the project folder 
    @app.route(): just sets an example for testing
    '''

            SECRET_KEY = "dev", 
            DATABASE = os.path.join(app.instance_path, "flaskr.sqlite"), )

    if test_config is None:
        # load the instance, if it exists, when not testing
