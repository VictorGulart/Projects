This function generates the URL to a view based on a name and arguments. The
name associated with a view is also called the endpoint, and by default it's
the same as the name of the view function.

For example the hello() view that was added to the app factory has the name
'hello' and can be linked to with url_for('hello'). If it took an argument, it
would be linked to using url_for('hello', who='World')/
